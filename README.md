## üé® My Pookalam

### Description
My digital Pookalam is a stunning web-based recreation of traditional Kerala floral art combined with the iconic Theyyam cultural heritage, built using React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies. This project beautifully merges the geometric precision of Pookalam designs with the mystical essence of Theyyam, creating a unique digital tribute to Kerala's rich cultural traditions.

The design features intricate concentric patterns with alternating colored triangular borders, decorative geometric overlays, and a central Theyyam face that represents the divine performer from Kerala's traditional ritual art form. Using SVG graphics and React components, the Pookalam showcases layered circular patterns with vibrant colors including traditional reds, yellows, greens, and maroons that are characteristic of both Pookalam and Theyyam art forms.

### Design Elements
- **Outer Border**: 32 alternating red and yellow triangular petals forming the outermost ring
- **Secondary Layer**: 24 triangular patterns in red and yellow creating depth
- **Decorative Rings**: Maroon and cream colored circular bands
- **Geometric Overlays**: Rotating rectangular patterns with transparency effects
- **Central Theyyam**: Traditional Theyyam face with detailed eyes, nose, and decorative elements
- **Floral Accents**: 28 small decorative flowers arranged in a circular pattern
